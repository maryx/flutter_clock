# Flutter Clock Helper

This package contains helper code for the Flutter Clock contest.

## Clock Customizer

Wrap your clock widget in the ClockCustomizer. It maintains a landscape clock with an aspect ratio of 5:3 and provides a drawer that allows you to change some system settings.

## Model

These are some items surfaced by the system settings. You can play around with the API. Reflecting each item in the UI is not required.
This includes:
 - `is24HourFormat`, whether the hour should display in 24-hour format, e.g. 15:00 vs. 03:00
